<h1>Automated Joiner Process for Onboarding</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this step-by-step lesson, I'll show you how to automate the joiner process, which will make the onboarding process easier than ever. See the amazing things you can do with Microsoft Forms as I show you how to make custom forms to collect important staff information. Next, we'll talk about Power Automate, a game-changing automation platform that can help you get rid of jobs that you do over and over again. Learn how to make strong workflows that combine Microsoft Forms with Azure AD, Microsoft's strong cloud-based identity and access control solution. When you put Azure AD to work, you'll see the magic of automation at play as new employee accounts are made automatically, saving you time and making sure that new hires have a smooth experience. I'll give you expert advice on how to set up and improve the whole process so that it fits the needs of your company.
